# PensionCALC Docs

## Hosted documentation

http://docs.pensioncalc.apiary.io/

## Instructions

These PensionCALC Docs are intended to render within [Apiary](http://apiary.io/). They are written in [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) according to the [API Blueprint Language specification](https://github.com/apiaryio/api-blueprint/blob/master/API%20Blueprint%20Specification.md).

Changes to the [`apiary.apib`](https://github.com/juliosantos/pension_calc_docs_apiary/blob/master/apiary.apib) file reflect immediately on the [Apiary-hosted documentation](http://docs.pensioncalc.apiary.io/).

Here's [a good example](http://docs.themoviedb.apiary.io/) of what a full set of docs can look like.

## On Apiary

Apiary is a toolset to collaboratively author and share APIs:

> Collaborative design, instant API mock, generated documentation, integrated code samples, debugging and automated testing.

They have [paid offerings](http://apiary.io/#pricing) with easier-than-github authoring and user management too, but the free version should be enough for now.

Learn more about [how it works](http://apiary.io/how-it-works).

## Ecosystem

Using Apiary doesn't lock us in. [The API Blueprint project](http://apiblueprint.org/) has a [decent ecosystem](http://apiblueprint.org/#tooling) and there are (less pretty) alternatives to the Apiary rendering like [iglo](https://github.com/subosito/iglo) and [blueprint-docify](https://github.com/renewablefunding/blueprint-docify)
